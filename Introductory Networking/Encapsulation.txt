Encapsulation is the idea that the more layers data goes through, the more information is added to the transmission.

In the transport layer / Level 4, data added is no longer referred to as data but as segments or datagrams.

In the network layer / Level 3, data is referred to as packets because it has been broken down into bits of information to carry at once.

In the Data Link layer / Level 2, data is referred to as a frame.

By the time the data is being transmitted across a network, it has been broken down into bits.

When the data is received by the computer, it begins the process of removing the extra information given. This process is called de-encapsulation as it is the opposite of encapsulation. 

Encapsulation and de-encapsulation give us a standardized way to send data. Standardized means that the network request will reach any device regradless of whether they run a different os, are from a different manifacturer, bla bla bla, Youget the point. Encapsulation provides an extra layer of security.

Encapsulation provides an extra layer of securit as data cannot be tampered with without breaking the trailer added in Level2.
