Domains are made for you not to remember every single ip adress for the websites you want to visit
Every domain translates into an IP adress.

Domains are given out by registars. When you want a domain, these are the people you go to.

The WHOIS tool shows you who the domain name is registered to. This is limited when it comes to Europe as personal details are reduced.

To make a search, use this syntax:
whois <domain>
