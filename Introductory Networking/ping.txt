The ping command is used to see if a connection with an ip adress is possible.

Ping uses the ICMP protocol.
The ICMP protocol works on the Network layer of the OSI model and the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.
The basic syntax is:
ping<target>

The ping command doesn't return the domain adress you're connecting to, but rather the ip adress. So this makes it also a good tool to find the ip adress of a website.

In order to change the interval of sent ping requrests use -i followed by the amount of seconds between each ping$

To restrict pings to ipv4 use: -4
To restrict pings to ipv6 use: -6
To have a more verbose output use: -V

Any extra syntax questions can be answered in the man page:
man ping
