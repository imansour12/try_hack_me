First of all, go to this link to start the machine: https://tryhackme.com/room/tutorial
There are two options from here on, you either start a virtual machine from the website which you can use to do the challenges. If you do this, open up firfox and paste in the ip adress given to you in the exercise and you should see your flag in the webpage.

On the other hand, if you want to do the challenge on your own machine, you'll have to use openvpn to connect to the tryhackme vpn and then use your browser to enter in the ip adress. You can download your openvpn config files from here: https://tryhackme.com/access?o=vpn . You should see the flag in the webpage. 
 
PS: If you only have a terminal in your posession you can use curl followed by the ip or web adress you want to connect to. Your flag will be at the end of the output.

Your commands will look sth like this:
openvpn <openvpnconfigfiledownloaded>
curl <ipadress>
